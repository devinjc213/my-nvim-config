# My Nvim Config
Nearly complete..  Some keybinds broken on Mac.. Needa figure out the command key keybind.

Just missing a working test runner, tried Jester and Neotest but having trouble getting those working.  Might need to write my own SFDX plugin..

Has LSP, Auto complete, syntax highlighting, file tree, fuzzy finder, copilot, git integration, and more.

Requires ripgrep for live grep file finder
