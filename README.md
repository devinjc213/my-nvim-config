# My Nvim Config
Nearly complete.. Just missing a working test runner, and ideally SFDX integration.  Tried Jester and Neotest but having trouble getting those working.

Has LSP, Auto complete, syntax highlting, file tree, fuzzy finder, copilot, git integration, and more.

Requires ripgrep for live grep file finder
